1. The unittest unit testing framework

   * A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associated cleanup actions
1. test case
  * A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which     may be used to create new test cases.
1. test suite
   * A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.
    
1. test runner
  * A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual      interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests.
