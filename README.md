   A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associated cleanup actions
1. test case
  A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which     may be used to create new test cases.
1. test suite
    A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.
